## 2026-01-22 - Icon-only Button Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like keypads or delete actions) are easy to miss during visual review but create major barriers for screen reader users. The 'DEL' button was completely invisible to screen readers.
**Action:** Always inspect component maps that generate buttons to ensure dynamic labels are applied, especially for non-text keys.
