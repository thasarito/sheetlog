## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility in Touch Interfaces
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like Keypad delete or Delete Transaction) often lack `aria-label`, making them invisible to screen readers.
**Action:** Always verify icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes. Add tactile feedback (`active:scale-95`) and touch optimization (`touch-manipulation`) to enhance the "native app" feel on mobile.
