## 2026-02-02 - Custom Keypad Interaction
**Learning:** Custom numeric keypads often lack standard mobile web behaviors like `touch-manipulation` (preventing double-tap zoom) and `select-none` (preventing accidental text selection), making them feel "web-like" rather than "native-like".
**Action:** Apply `touch-manipulation select-none active:scale-95` to all custom keypad buttons to mimic native app responsiveness.
