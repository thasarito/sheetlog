## 2026-01-05 - Improve Keypad Backspace UX
**Learning:** Text-only buttons like "DEL" can be functional but lack polish. Replacing them with standard icons (like a backspace icon) significantly improves the visual quality and aligns with mobile platform conventions. Always ensure icon-only buttons have an `aria-label` for accessibility.
**Action:** When working on numeric keypads or similar inputs, prefer standard icons for control keys (backspace, enter) over text labels, and double-check a11y.
